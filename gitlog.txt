2020-12-30->0.51
- vkmgr.py: new class VKManager.
- satnode.py: new class satnode
- get rid of bitdic, branch, relationmanager and workbudder
2020-12-28->0.50
- debug rm
- realized, that untouched should be seperated from touched:
  touched is child-specific, but untouched should be shared among all
  children: solve the next level with untouched(without touched). the solution
  can be combined with every child of the parent-br.
- although the br is based on first 3-bits (bestkey), but the other 3-bits
  keys, are they needed?
2020-12-27->0.49
- coding rm.
2020-12-26->0.48
- progress
2020-12-25->0.47
- new class RelationManager.
2020-12-25->0.46
- brached from solver8. Plan to try out enhancing bitdic: relations-manager
  inside bitdic, or outside? Holding vks-dic, vk2-dic and vk1-dic?
2020-12-25->0.45
- minor polish, before branching off to solver9
2020-12-24->0.45
- found bugs: 1. Tx: wrong generated odd number of txs? fixed: using set ops
- vklause.clone(drops) can return empty vk.dic, in that case, not adding to vkd.
- cfg100-450 now uses 113 secs. Much better now, but still room to optimise.
2020-12-23->0.44
- branch/spawn untouchset vks will not be txed: no need to clone for every
  child bitdic. Share them will save some run.
2020-12-22->0.43
- Tx: txs no more a list of tuples, but dict. get rid of trans_value 
  reverse_value stuff.
- use class variable Branch.LAYERS for holde the tree
- cfg100-450.json failed to have result - debugging
2020-12-22->0.42
- get rid of visualizr.py, TransKlauseEngine.test_me, vklause.value_overshadow 
  vklause.set_completion,.position_value, move set_value_and_mask from __init__
  tp vklause.hit.
- in BitDic, move add_vk to be a method - no more inside of add_klause
  All these reduced run ti
  m for cfg100-450.json from 168 secs to 164
  cProfile time from 260 to 231 secs (see docs/2020-12-21-042=100-450.info)
- Branch/spawn: check for outdics length==1 and have opposite 0/1: 
  this branch-child is not to exist
- BitDic get_choice now returns changed...
2020-12-21->0.41
- get rid of nbits in vklause. This reduced cProfile run time for 
  cfg100-450.json from 542secs to 277 sec.
  see (see docs/2020-12-21-041=100-450.info)
2020-12-21->0.40
- cfg100-450 with solver4 was 438(533 secs cProfile) secs returning all sats. 
  Now solver8 return only 1, but use 488(542secs cProfile) secs
  (see docs/2020-12-21-040=100-450.info)
  I am disappointed. But using python -m cProfile gave me some insights, for
  optimization.
2020-12-21->0.39
- verification not run on normal process. *.sat file now have more info.
  python solver8.py *.sat will verify the sat in sat file
2020-12-20->0.38
- choice returned by BitDic.get_choice now has 3 in the tuple:
  kn, tsvk, tcvk, so that the kn will not be popped from tsvk
- branch.nov3 now uses set ops to simpify. It works.
2020-12-20->0.37
- refactored bitdic having new get_choice and best_choice. remove transfer
- get rid of makechoice.py
- moving topbits_coverages to basics, get rid of drop_bits
2020-12-19->0.36
- best choice will be made among the shortest vks. At beginning it is 3-bits,
  but down the tree 1,2 are preferred.
- before making choice among vk1s, check if they cover totality
  totality means: among the 1 bit vk, there exist two sitting on the same bit,
  with opposite values(0 and 1)
- if branch has totality, of spawned no children, it is renamed 'finished',
  and it is removed from parent's children-dic
2020-12-19->0.35
- based on solver7/0.34
2020-12-18->0.34
- Sat.nov class var holding nov. In Sat.verify looping thru vks, make
  sure vk.bits[0] < Sat.nove - safty guard.
2020-12-18->0.33
- VKlause.hit now can test if vk is hit by a sat( lst of tuples)
- python solver7.py *.sat will verify *.sat file
2020-12-18->0.32
- new class Sat for verifying and saving into .sat file
- VKlause.hit test now also accept v as a list of pairs: (<bit>,<bool-value>)
- WorkBuffer.build_sats: use the end-node, trace all the way back to root
  and collecting segment-sats to build a complete sat-array.
- it works on config1.json, verified, and outputted in verify/config1.sat
2020-12-17->0.31
- put satholder in use, workbuffer/build_sats make the final sats
  still bug: in [(3, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1), (0, 1), (7, 1), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0)]
  last 2 bits should be (0,0),(1,1), not (0,1),(1,0)!
  But still big progress.
- TBD: make solver7/verify_sats
2020-12-16->0.30
- introducing SatHolder mechanism. Done incomplete impls: TBD
2020-12-15->0.29
- if nov becomes 3, check for sats
- in makechoice/best_vk1: handle when no g1-vk exists.
- on level-0 branch, parent is original bitdic. lower brs will
  have branch as parent.
2020-12-15->0.28
- move basic stuff into basics, make_vkdic to bitdic
- add branch/nov3() for testing nov==3 coverage,... TBD
2020-12-14->0.27
- run till" r->(r1, r5, r7) ->{r11, r51} ->{r110 } ->{r1101}
  r1101: nov==2: C032:{0:0}, C004: {1:0}
  @ branch.py:65/chdic = self.prepare() having issue @makechoice.py:243
  max argument empty. I am near to my near goal!
2020-12-14->0.26
- vklause now has a method: .value_overshadow(vkx), testing if, in case 
  self.dic has the same number of, or less bits than vkx, if the value-range 
  of vkx is already covered by self. this is useful when testing vk1 or
  later vk2
2020-12-14->0.25
- bug fixes.
- TBD: r7 has issue. It should resolve.
2020-12-13->0.24

in stead of 2.
