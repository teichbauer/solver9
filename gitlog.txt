2021-01-22->0.85
- impl vk12m.morph the same way as in vkm.morph. TBD: test
2021-01-21->0.84
- refactored vkmgr/morph, and vk12m: now use vkdic, and kn1s/kn2s
- TBD: vk12m.morph
2021-01-20->0.83
- simplify what last checked in.
2021-01-20->0.82
- recode vkmgr.morph, and crownmanager/satnode.
2021-01-20->0.81
- optimized vkmgr.bestchoice: take away all tsvk kns from candidates - Because
  a kn can not be in >1 best-keys. This reduce the loop-count.
2021-01-19->0.80
- possible bug in vkmgr.py/morph: I should loop thru all 2**3 == 8 vals?
  TBD: analysis
- coding in crown and crownmanager for covering when only 1 vk left.
2021-01-18->0.79
- fix in satnode cdic[1] > cdic.get(1,{}), cdic[2] > cdic.get(2, {})
- progress on handling the case of cown top-level node with only 1 vk
2021-01-18->0.78
- refactored/fixed/optimized satnode and vkmananger. Still backwards compatible.
2021-01-17->0.77
- change crown.csats to be list of tuple: (sat-dic, leef-node12-name). Because
  a crown may have multiple sat-dics.
2021-01-17->0.76
- tested with config1.json: crown/node12 start working, and deliver psats with 
  {7:1, 6:2, 5:1, 4:0, 3:1, 2:0, 1:1, 0:0}, where 6:2 means a wild-card for v6.
2021-01-15->0.75
- move merge_sats from node12 to basics.
- progress on managing sats-branching, from crown to bottom-level node12.
  Need more testing
2021-01-14->0.74
- fixing crown, vk12m.
2021-01-13->0.73
- progressing.
2021-01-12->0.72
- new design / impl.: crown/crown-manager, interactions with satnode. 
  Not yet finished.
2021-01-11->0.71
- sat2 partial sats management in node12
- TBD: interaction between node12 and satnode.
2021-01-11->0.70
- progress on vk12mgr and node12, on collecting sats. Some refactoring on both.
2021-01-10->0.69
- fixes in vk12mgr and node12.
2021-01-08->0.68
- tested vk2 as bvk (multiple), and if bvk_cvs counts 4 (2**2 ==4)
  then no space left -> self.terminated = True
- vk12m.bvk_cvs is a set, no more list.
2021-01-08->0.67
- tested vk12m.best_vk2, with manually deleted vk1dic in config1,json
  setting.
- refactored some.
2021-01-08->0.66
- code for vk12m: in case no vk1 exists, pick the best vk2. Always set a list
  self.bvk_cvs, either from vk1 bvk or vk2 bvk. Now in morph, test if a value
  is in self.bvk_cvs, for exclusion.
- refactored 
2021-01-07->0.65
- enhanced satholder with get_psats dic for tracing {var>:<val>,..}
- refactored/optimized basics/node12/satnode
- TBD: issue: vk12m - if no vk1, when picking bvk, there can be multiple
  vk2 sitting on the same 2 bits, in that case exccl-cvs?
  And, how pick the best vk2?
2021-01-06->0.64
- minor fix. The approach introed by 0.63 works!
2021-01-06->0.63
- believe found the bug/fixed: when doing vk12m.clone(), bvk not set.
  this causes isse when calling topbits_coverages(vkm.bvk, topbits)
  Solution: vk12m.txed_clone or vk12m.clone both will NOT set bvk.
  But vk12m now has a method .bvk_topvalue. Node12.spaw(): before doing
  tx, get cv = self.vk12m.bvk_topvalue() and use this cv in vk12m.morph
  This also optimized away topbits_coverages in node12 and vk12m.
- TBD: test it
2021-01-06->0.62
- optimized a bit for VK12Manager constructor: choices for call/not-call
  of make_bdic and normalize.
- still need to find/fix the bug in 0.61
2021-01-05->0.61
- effort to pick default vk1 as bvk with the 1 bit sit on highst pos.
  This can  optimize. But this has brought in a bug. Need to find it.
  TBD.
2021-01-05->0.60
- give node12 inst a name. children is a list now (was dict)
- pick highst bit vk1 as default bvk in vk12m
- tried node12.spawn (9-7/8-1/7-1/6-1/5-1/4-1/3-1) to the end: 
  sofar so good
2021-01-04->0.59
- refactored/fixed vk12mgr, and node12
- made satnode's loop thru children with sorted val-keys. When loop with
  for k, v in dict.items(), it is really not deterministic about the calling
  sequence. I need that in debugging.
- tested cfg12-45's children(1,2,3,4,5,6,7)'s spawn. With the reduction in
  child-5's C0016/C0045 removed by nov==8/vk1:C0044
  child-6's C0013/C0002 removed by nov==8/vk1: C0014/C0009
  So far node12 works fine with vk12mgr.
  TBD: node12.spawn all the way till one child finds sats?
2021-01-04->0.58
- progress on vk12m / node12
2021-01-04->0.57
- coded vk12mgr/morph, node12/spawn
2021-01-03->0.56
- progress on vk12mgr.py and node12.py
2021-01-03->0.55
- Node12 will take care of vk12dic, for every satnode's child.
- new class VK12Manager / vk12m.py
2021-01-02->0.54
- When making crowns in vkm.morph, now consider bvk cover value (blokc it)
- progress in crown.py
2020-12-31->0.53a
- cfg12-45.json has 7 sats: 
  [2355, 2363, 2419, 2427, 3299, 3315, 3443]. in 9-12 space (max 512):
  [2355, 2363, 2419, 2427] are in 4-th subspace: [307, 315, 371, 379]
  [3299, 3315, 3443] are in 6-th subspace: [227, 243, 371]

- analized cfg12-45 split behavior. After txed on C0006{10:0,8:0,1:0} and 
  C0017 {10:1,8:1,1:1}->[11,10,9], there are 12 vk3 left untouched,31 touched.

  from the 8 children, 0 and 7 are covered by base C0006 and C0017.
  all 8 children:
  0: cfg12-45-0-9-17.json (17=vk1s + vk2s): no sat
     cfg12-45-0-9-29-vk123.json (29: all vks): no sats

  2: cfg12-45-2-9-13.json (13=vk1s + vk2s): 1 sat: [270] not in cfg9-12's sats
     cfg12-45-2-9-25-vk123.json (25: all vks): no sat

2020-12-31->0.52
- crown now has vk1dic/vk2dic, saved under child-dic[val]. The sum vk12dic is 
  saved on parent/self .vk12dic
- looking into cfg12-45 case, for design analysis: txed with C0006/C0017 as base
  all sollution *.tx files saved under docs
2020-12-30->0.51
- vkmgr.py: new class VKManager.
- satnode.py: new class satnode
- get rid of bitdic, branch, relationmanager and workbudder
2020-12-28->0.50
- debug rm
- realized, that untouched should be seperated from touched:
  touched is child-specific, but untouched should be shared among all
  children: solve the next level with untouched(without touched). the solution
  can be combined with every child of the parent-br.
- although the br is based on first 3-bits (bestkey), but the other 3-bits
  keys, are they needed?
2020-12-27->0.49
- coding rm.
2020-12-26->0.48
- progress
2020-12-25->0.47
- new class RelationManager.
2020-12-25->0.46
- brached from solver8 -> solver9
  Plan to try out enhancing bitdic: relations-manager
  inside bitdic, or outside? Holding vks-dic, vk2-dic and vk1-dic?
2020-12-25->0.45
- minor polish, before branching off to solver9
2020-12-24->0.45
- found bugs: 1. Tx: wrong generated odd number of txs? fixed: using set ops
- vklause.clone(drops) can return empty vk.dic, in that case, not adding to vkd.
- cfg100-450 now uses 113 secs. Much better now, but still room to optimise.
2020-12-23->0.44
- branch/spawn untouchset vks will not be txed: no need to clone for every
  child bitdic. Share them will save some run.
2020-12-22->0.43
- Tx: txs no more a list of tuples, but dict. get rid of trans_value 
  reverse_value stuff.
- use class variable Branch.LAYERS for holde the tree
- cfg100-450.json failed to have result - debugging
2020-12-22->0.42
- get rid of visualizr.py, TransKlauseEngine.test_me, vklause.value_overshadow 
  vklause.set_completion,.position_value, move set_value_and_mask from __init__
  tp vklause.hit.
- in BitDic, move add_vk to be a method - no more inside of add_klause
  All these reduced run ti
  m for cfg100-450.json from 168 secs to 164
  cProfile time from 260 to 231 secs (see docs/2020-12-21-042=100-450.info)
- Branch/spawn: check for outdics length==1 and have opposite 0/1: 
  this branch-child is not to exist
- BitDic get_choice now returns changed...
2020-12-21->0.41
- get rid of nbits in vklause. This reduced cProfile run time for 
  cfg100-450.json from 542secs to 277 sec.
  see (see docs/2020-12-21-041=100-450.info)
2020-12-21->0.40
- cfg100-450 with solver4 was 438(533 secs cProfile) secs returning all sats. 
  Now solver8 return only 1, but use 488(542secs cProfile) secs
  (see docs/2020-12-21-040=100-450.info)
  I am disappointed. But using python -m cProfile gave me some insights, for
  optimization.
2020-12-21->0.39
- verification not run on normal process. *.sat file now have more info.
  python solver8.py *.sat will verify the sat in sat file
2020-12-20->0.38
- choice returned by BitDic.get_choice now has 3 in the tuple:
  kn, tsvk, tcvk, so that the kn will not be popped from tsvk
- branch.nov3 now uses set ops to simpify. It works.
2020-12-20->0.37
- refactored bitdic having new get_choice and best_choice. remove transfer
- get rid of makechoice.py
- moving topbits_coverages to basics, get rid of drop_bits
2020-12-19->0.36
- best choice will be made among the shortest vks. At beginning it is 3-bits,
  but down the tree 1,2 are preferred.
- before making choice among vk1s, check if they cover totality
  totality means: among the 1 bit vk, there exist two sitting on the same bit,
  with opposite values(0 and 1)
- if branch has totality, of spawned no children, it is renamed 'finished',
  and it is removed from parent's children-dic
2020-12-19->0.35
- based on solver7/0.34
2020-12-18->0.34
- Sat.nov class var holding nov. In Sat.verify looping thru vks, make
  sure vk.bits[0] < Sat.nove - safty guard.
2020-12-18->0.33
- VKlause.hit now can test if vk is hit by a sat( lst of tuples)
- python solver7.py *.sat will verify *.sat file
2020-12-18->0.32
- new class Sat for verifying and saving into .sat file
- VKlause.hit test now also accept v as a list of pairs: (<bit>,<bool-value>)
- WorkBuffer.build_sats: use the end-node, trace all the way back to root
  and collecting segment-sats to build a complete sat-array.
- it works on config1.json, verified, and outputted in verify/config1.sat
2020-12-17->0.31
- put satholder in use, workbuffer/build_sats make the final sats
  still bug: in [(3, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1), (0, 1), (7, 1), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0)]
  last 2 bits should be (0,0),(1,1), not (0,1),(1,0)!
  But still big progress.
- TBD: make solver7/verify_sats
2020-12-16->0.30
- introducing SatHolder mechanism. Done incomplete impls: TBD
2020-12-15->0.29
- if nov becomes 3, check for sats
- in makechoice/best_vk1: handle when no g1-vk exists.
- on level-0 branch, parent is original bitdic. lower brs will
  have branch as parent.
2020-12-15->0.28
- move basic stuff into basics, make_vkdic to bitdic
- add branch/nov3() for testing nov==3 coverage,... TBD
2020-12-14->0.27

  @ branch.py:65/chdic = self.prepare() having issue @makechoice.py:243
  max argument empty. I am near to my near goal!
2020-12-14->0.26
- vklause now has a method: .value_overshadow(vkx), testing if, in case 
  self.dic has the same number of, or less bits than vkx, if the value-range 
  of vkx is already covered by self. this is useful when testing vk1 or
  later vk2
2020-12-14->0.25
- bug fixes.
- TBD: r7 has issue. It should resolve.
2020-12-13->0.24
- refactored wb, bitdic, branch
